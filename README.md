# Project1
## This was going to be my first project repo.
<b>Funnily enough, I actually made this as a local folder with all the right files, but I never actually made it into a Github repository. Up until the final delivery quiz, I thought I had done it properly. I couldn't find anything on the Google Classroom saying that this had to be a folder in our Github repo's, and if there was then I clearly didn't see it; and that's on me if that's the case.</b>
